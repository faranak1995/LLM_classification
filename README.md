# LLM_classification
LLM Classification using Python
This repository provides a comprehensive guide to using Large Language Models (LLMs) in Python. It covers the application of models such as BERT, GPT, and other Transformer-based architectures for tasks like sentiment analysis, text generation, and more. The tutorial includes step-by-step instructions on how to work with these models using popular Python libraries such as transformers, PyTorch, and TensorFlow.

## Introduction
Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) due to their ability to perform a wide range of language tasks with high accuracy. This tutorial will guide you through the necessary steps to train, fine-tune, and utilize these models using Python.

### Key Topics Covered:
- Introduction to Transformers and Pre-trained Models
- Setting up the Python environment
- Using Hugging Faceâ€™s Transformers library
- Implementing common NLP tasks such as sentiment analysis and text generation
- Fine-tuning pre-trained models

## Prerequisites
Before you start, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:
- Python 3.6+
- Pip (Python package installer)
- A text editor or IDE (e.g., Visual Studio Code, PyCharm)

Additionally, you should have some familiarity with Python programming and machine learning concepts.
